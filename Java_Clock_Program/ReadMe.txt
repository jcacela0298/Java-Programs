# Java Clock Program

I built a program that can tell the time in different formats based on three number inputs. 

If you would like a tutorial on how to correctly upload/download Java Eclipse projects to/from GitHub, check out my YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCrTzBX3OOg&t=2s

To use this program, open both .Java files in your favorite IDE for Java (I use Eclipse). Make sure the names of the respective files are MyTimeMain.java and MyTime.java, corresponding to the names of the first class within each file. Also, ensure that the name of the package at the top of each file corresponds to the name of the project's package that each file is in. Then, run the MyTimeMain file and it will prompt you to enter three numbers in the format of HH MM SS, not separated by commas. Here is an example with 13 1 1:

Enter hour minute and second (-1 to exit)
13 1 1
Values read were: 13 1 1
1:01:01 PM
13:01:01
hour is 13  minute is 1  second is 1

There is another file in this folder called Output.txt that has more examples.

During this project, I learned more about passing and accepting parameters, built-in Java methods such as Integer.toString() that can accept parameters, multiple variable declaration statements, do-while loops, assigning scanned values to variables, packages, instance variables, = vs. ==, if/else statements, boolean methods, modulo operator, ternary operators, concatenation, the meaning of "this", and overall Java syntax.
