# URL Encoder Program

I built a program with Lance Smith that can construct an encoded URL based on values entered in by the user.

If you would like instructions on how to clone this project before the instructions on what to do after running the main file, check out the "How to clone this project.txt" file. 

Run the main "MyUrlDemo.java" file and it will prompt you to enter a base URL such as amazon.com. Once done, it will prompt for an argument name, then an argument value type, and then an argument value. It will add these to the base URL, and keep prompting for more input until you type "done". Here is an example of input and output:

Enter URL site (or 'exit')...
Url value read was: www.barnesandnoble.com
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a string value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a string value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a double value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
URL with appended arguments is:
  http://www.barnesandnoble.com?publisher=Addison+%26+Wesley&title=Does+e%3dmc2+%3f&price=19.95

There is another file in this folder called URL Program Output.txt that has more examples.

During this project, I learned more about passing and accepting parameters, Java scanner functionality, utilizing other methods, Url encoding, variable declaration statements, assigning scanned values to variables, packages, instance variables, concatenation, appending strings, and overall Java syntax.
