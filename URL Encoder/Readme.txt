Run the main "MyUrlDemo.java" file and it will prompt you to enter a base URL such as amazon.com. Once done, it will prompt for an argument name, then an argument value type, and then an argument value. It will add these to the base URL, and keep prompting for more input until you type "done". Here is an example of input and output:

There is another file in this folder called URL Input Output.txt that has an input/output example.

During this project, I learned more about passing and accepting parameters, Java scanner functionality, utilizing other methods, Url encoding, variable declaration statements, assigning scanned values to variables, packages, instance variables, concatenation, appending strings, and overall Java syntax.
