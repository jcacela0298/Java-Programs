# URL Encoder Program

I built a program with Lance Smith that can construct an encoded URL based on values entered in by the user.

To use this program, open both .Java files in your favorite IDE for Java (I use Eclipse). Make sure the names of the respective files correspond to the names of the first class within each file. Also, ensure that the name of the package at the top of each file corresponds to the name of the project's package that each file is in. Then, run the MyUrlDemo file and it will prompt you to enter in a base url such as amazon.com. Once done, it will prompt for an argument name, then an argument value type, and then an argument value. It will add this to the base url and keep prompting you for more input until you type done. Here is an example of input and output:

Enter URL site (or 'exit')...
Url value read was: www.barnesandnoble.com
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a string value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a string value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
Enter type of argument value (string, integer, double)...
Enter a double value
Enter URL argument name (or 'done')...
URL with appended arguments is:
  http://www.barnesandnoble.com?publisher=Addison+%26+Wesley&title=Does+e%3dmc2+%3f&price=19.95

There is another file in this folder called URL Program Output.txt that has more examples.

During this project, I learned more about passing and accepting parameters, Java scanner functionality, utilizing other methods, Url encoding, variable declaration statements, assigning scanned values to variables, packages, instance variables, concatenation, appending strings, and overall Java syntax.
