First download Git at: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Then, find where you downloaded the Git folder and make sure that the path to Git's bin file is added to your system's path environment variable.

Next, open up a command prompt, clone the entire repository you want to take a project from. For example, type: 

git clone https://github.com/jcacela0298/Java-Programs.git

This means that you have just downloaded the repository as a folder, and it is stored on your desktop in the directory in which you are located in the command prompt -- so now open your IDE and do file > open projects from file system > choose the directory where you cloned the repository and choose the folder (which is the project) that you want the java files from. Once you import them into your IDE, there are a few things I like to make sure I do:

1.) Make sure the java files are nested within the correct package
2.) Make sure the package nomenclature is correct in the java files
3.) Make sure that the package is within an src file
4.) The general rule is to compile classes in the order of dependency. If class A depends on class B, compile B first, and then A. So in order to compile the first file, you go to the command prompt and, making sure you are in the right directory (with src as part of it), type javac __(file name here)__

Example: javac MyUrl.java

5.) Once all the files are compiled in the right order, make sure to run the java file that has the main method.
