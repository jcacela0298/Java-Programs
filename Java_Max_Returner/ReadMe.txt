This project was completed by Jack Cacela. This Java MaxValueReturn project is designed to accept three integer parameters and return the highest value.

In order to run this file, download the MaxValueReturn.java file into your favorite IDE, and then run the MaxValueReturn.java file. When we run the MaxValueReturn.java file, the main method calls the max method which compares each integer parameter value that the user manually inputs within the main method, assesses which is the highest, and returns that integer. 

Make sure you manually put the parameters you wish at line 15 -- The default parameters are 700, 500, and 500, which are three valid integers, and this should return 700.

I learned many things throughout this project. While the max() method in the MaxValueReturn class is static, that means in order to call it in a different class, we need to use that method's class name. However, since we are using it within the same class, we do not need to use the format MaxValueReturn.max() - We can just use max().

I also learned that we don't necessarily need a helper class to handle logic if the code is not complex. Since we only have some logic, it makes sense to just keep it all organized in one file.
