For Java, I have two programs that I am most proud of. 

Candidate number one is my Hike Tracker Program. This program integrates with a MySQL database that allows the user to enter in the Name, State, Miles, Date, and Difficulty from 1(easy) to 5 (difficult) of hikes that the user has completed, or plans to complete. There are three buttons called "add", "edit", and "delete", which grant the user the ability to customize the hike tracker record table with ease. I employ all of my code organization & readability techniques that I have learned in Java along the way.

Candidate number two is my Java SpringBoot Application, which was part of my Java SpringBoot 3 Certification. This application uses Docker, Postgres, and Maven to create a rest API with Spring Boot, so that customers can use Postman to make various requests (such as post, get, and delete) to and from our customer database. These requests travel to our customer database API, flowing through our business layer, DAO layer, and then to a real database (Postgres running on Docker) to receive appropriate responses, all while using N-tier architecture (where each layer is responsible for only one single thing). 
We can input customer data in the database via terminal, but we wanted to expose an API endpoint that clients can use to achieve the same thing in a more user-friendly manner using Postman.
