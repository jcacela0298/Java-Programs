I am most proud of Java Hike Tracker Program. I built a program that integrates with a MySQL database that allows the user to enter in the Name, State, Miles, Date, and Difficulty from 1(easy) to 5 (difficult) of hikes that the user has completed, or plans to complete. There are three buttons called "add", "edit", and "delete", which grant the user the ability to customize the hike tracker record table with ease.I employ all of my code organization & readability techniques that I have learned along the way.
