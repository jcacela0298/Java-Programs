# Java Clock Program

I built a program that can tell the time in different formats based on three number inputs. 

To use this program, open both .Java files in your favorite IDE for Java (I use Eclipse), and run the MyTimeMain file. Make sure the name of the respective files are MyTimeMain and MyTime, and also ensure that the name of the package at the top corresponds to the name of the package that each file is in. Once you do so, it will prompt you to enter three numbers in the format of HH MM SS, not separated by commas. Here is an example with 13 1 1:

Enter hour minute and second (-1 to exit)
13 1 1
Values read were: 13 1 1
1:01:01 PM
13:01:01
hour is 13  minute is 1  second is 1

There is another file in this folder called Output.txt that has more examples.

During this project I learned more about passing and accepting parameters, built in Java methods such as Integer.toString() that can accept parameters, multiple variable declaration statements, do-while loops, assigning scanned values to variables, packages, instance variables, = vs. ==, if/else statements, boolean methods, modulo operator, ternary operators, concatenation, and overall Java syntax.
